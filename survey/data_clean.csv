However, my team is still asked to produce promotional print materials for one-time events/campaigns/etc. that cannot be reused or recycled.

Stella Yuan,Student,Student,8.75,"What bugs me - no, what I feel uncontrollably viscerally - is the sheer food waste in Val. People regularly throw out ~25% of their meal, which is already painful. It becomes even more frustrating when the line for a particular food is long. Similarly, when Val runs out of a particularly delectable food, I know I can find enough of the food for myself... in the trash. Speaking of, most people but not everyone is composting food or containers; perhaps providing covers on the trash bins but no covers on the compost bins would deter people? Something must be done about the compostable to-go containers and cups; people are still using them frequently. Can there be more recycling bins in Val? A simple solution concerns people who get ice cream in to-go containers since they are near the ice cream machine. If ceramic bowls took the spot of those to-go containers next to the ice cream machine, that would help. I believe people feel fine about food waste here since the unlimited meal plan is a flat fee. Although it is not a possibility here, if they prepared their own food, they may realize how much food waste costs. Lastly, eating habits are deplorable, although it is nearly impossible for the school to change them. Those habits can only be changed by peer pressure (or by an unimaginable famine). For example, when peers eat an apple, they eat a ring around the core; when I eat an apple, I eat as close to the stem and seeds as possible. Peers do not maneuver around bones to eat all the chicken meat, do not drink every drop of soup, do not scoop the yogurt bowl clean. These problems have only peer pressure (or famine) as guaranteed solutions, but moving to-go containers to obscure places and covering up trash bins and providing recycling bins are a good start.",Asian,Woman,2026,Chemistry,,100.0,2141.0,"Yes, I live on campus.",None of the above,Yes,Other,"Car, and AAS shuttle",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Charles Pratt,,,"Book &amp; Plow Farm,EcoReps Program,Bike Share Program,Tread Shed Bike Shop,Sustainable Solutions Lab,Sustainability Trek Program",,"Free Clothing Giveaway (@ the Ice Rink),Bike Share Program (@ the Gym),Campus Wildlife Sanctuary Trails,Book and Plow Farm","Community service - refers to uncompensated work performed for the benefit and betterment of a community,Community-based learning - a teaching and learning approach that integrates community service with academic study to enrich learning, teach civic responsibility and strengthen communities,Other civic engagement programs on campus (e.g., AC Votes, Reproductive Justice Alliance, Environmental Justice Alliance)","Dining hall single-use cups and utensils,Plastic bottles,Food scraps,Napkins,Cardboard boxes,Red Solo cups,Aluminum cans,Glass bottles",I don't know,2030,I don't know,To a great extent,To a great extent,To a great extent,To a great extent,To a great extent,Neutral,Agree,Agree,Very important,Very important,Very important,Very important,,Economy,Meeting the needs of the present generation without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs,Space Exploration - Support humanity's expansion across the final frontier.,All of the above,Resilience,Greenhouse gasses,"Increase in severe weather,Loss of habitats in most regions,Displacement of people living in coastal areas","Solar,Wind,Hydropower,Geothermal",Beef,I don’t know,I don’t know,I don't know,"xml:space=""preserve"">All communities, regardless of race, color, national origin, sex, gender, ability level, age, or income, are involved in a meaningful way in setting regulations to protect their environment ","Office of Sustainability Newsletter,Flyers / Posters,Daily Mammoth"

Ryan Kurtz,Regular,Staff,13.0,"Amherst College has been a disappointment in how it has navigated and addressed meaningful environmental issues. The office of sustainability has also been blatantly misleading the community concerning how proactive the college has been in making sustainability focused changes. The recent work to transition the heating system was touted as being a demonstration of how committed to combating global warming and at the forefront of climate issues Amherst is. However, the college is about 20 years too late to be making such claims. At this point there is nothing proactive about this transition it is simply overdue. In fact, the college seems completely determined to not do anything radically meaningful to address any environmental concerns. The half measures and posturing that is done to pretend that impacts are being made is completely transparent. &#xa;&#xa;Anyone who knows the extent to which climate change and loss of biodiversity will impact the world also knows without a shadow of a doubt that divesting from oil conveniently over many years isn't a rational decision, it's a financial one with little concern for anything other than the bottom dollar. Also, hoarding more than 5 billion dollars instead of using whatever resources are necessary to become a 100% self sustaining campus and to make positive impacts on the local and regional environment is not only near-sighted it's arguably criminal. I understand these issues do not begin and end in the office of sustainability. 16 of our 23 board members work predominantly or exclusively with managing money. The number who have any experience or noted interest in sustainability or environmental issues is one. A single board member, who was previously an also equity manager. &#xa;&#xa;The focus on money and appearance over everything else here is disgusting and is the exact reason Amherst needs dramatic change to address its public opinion issues. In order to be a respectable institution in todays world our focus must shift, the efforts must be improved and the priorities need to be realigned to promote and protect our biodiversity and environment. There is absolutely nothing more important. One final thing, littering cigarette butts is not only illegal (even on privately owned land) it is also a substantial environmental concern that leads to leching of toxic chemicals into the water supply. Roughly 9.7billion get thrown every year in the US alone. I have seen nothing be done about this on campus despite seeing people throw them nearly every single day.

Jonathan Friedman,Faculty,Faculty,2.0,The college should put solar panels on Beneski and other buildings with south-facing roofs.  The Maine solar farm is really an offset and doesn't directly reduce our carbon usage (but does so indirectly).  The return on investment of solar is probably higher than the return on investment of the endowment in general so putting solar on buildings makes good financial sense.  ,White,Man,,,&gt; 15 years,100.0,372.0,"No, I live off-campus.",,,,,5.0,Walk   ,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,I don’t know,,,,"Campus Wildlife Sanctuary Trails,Book and Plow Farm",,,"Dining hall single-use cups and utensils,Plastic bottles,Food scraps,Napkins,Cardboard boxes,Red Solo cups,Aluminum cans,Glass bottles",I don't know,2030,Solar,To some extent,To some extent,To some extent,To some extent,To some extent,Agree,Agree,Agree,No opinion,No opinion,Very important,Somewhat important,I would like to skip this section,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Office of Sustainability Newsletter

Joshua Baum,Regular,Staff,3.0,"1. Increase the number of EV chargers on campus and keep them maintained. Currently 1 (science center) of the 4 has been broken for a while with no estimate of when it will be fixed. They are heavily used and almost always full! If you check the Chargepoint stats I'm sure the data will show the dramatic rise in their usage over the past 2 years. l love this perk to my job and it encourages EV adoption - charging at work actually made it practical and possible to buy a Bolt EV since I can't charge at home. You may also consider having a registration system or code to limit the chargers to just Amherst community - sometimes they are filled by locals seeking a free charge.&#xa;&#xa;2. Fix the very poorly labeled recycling and trash bins throughout the academic buildings. This has been a problem for 10+ years since we switched to single stream. The small bins in classrooms and larger bins in halls are confusing and poorly labeled. Many of the recycling bins still say &quot;paper only&quot; or have weirdly shaped tops that suggest recycling but have no labeling on the outside. Some are red, some are blue, some are gray, some are brown. I am very careful about recycling but often have no idea which bin to use. I see trash in the recycling and recycling in trash all the time. We need very clearly labeled bins to encourage higher recycling (and perhaps composting!) rates and reduce waste.&#xa;&#xa;3. Even better than driving single-occupancy EVs would be free bus passes year-round for staff and faculty and working with the PVTA to improve the frequency of the most common commuting routes. I used to use the bus from downtown Northampton but they discontinued the route. So the bus no longer leaves at convenient times for the trip to work (arriving at 9am) and would take 1hr+ to get home. Not great. It's a 20-25 min drive, 35-40 min bike ride, or 40min-1hr+ bus ride. Cycling is tough in cold and bad weather. So the bus is by far least efficient in terms of time. This is from the center of Northampton, not some out of the way suburb.
